    <p class="subSub" style="clear: both;"><i>INTEX Winter 2024 Project</i></p>
    <br>
    <p class="bodyText">
        INTEX is an abbreviation for "Integrated Experience," a project in which BYU Information Systems
        students are released from classes for a week to spend all their time on developing a web application.
        Over the course of four days, I and a team of 3 others spent about 90 hours each developing
        shopbrickwell.org, an online storefront for a fictional LEGO influencer name Aurora Brickwell. 
        Unfortunately the website is no longer online due to high costs and the limited budget of a college
        student, but the videos below demonstrate the app's functions and features. The app still functions
        locally--reach out to me if you'd like to check it out!
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="subSub">The Basics</h2>
    <p class="bodyText">
        In this video, my teammate Mark demonstrates the basic layout and functionality of the app, including
        features exlusive to authenticated users and administrators.

        The app uses machine learning algorithms to make product-based reccomendations to all users, 
        to make user-based reccomendations to authenticated users, and to detect and flag orders that
        are likely to be fraudulent. My teammates Ã§Mark and Patrick walk through these features in the
        video below.

        HTTPS, HSTS, multi-factor authentication, third-party authentication, RBAC, database security, and CSP.

    <h2 class="subSub">Other Details</h2>
    <p class="bodyText">
        The application was extensively prototyped with Figma and built using ASP .NET MVC Core. The app and 
        its two databases (one for products and other information, and one for identity and role-based access 
        control) were all originally hosted on Microsoft Azure until no longer financially feasible. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="bodyText">
        Each member of the team contributed to every part of the application, but my largest contributions
        included designing the prototype, building and routing the product/products views, developing the 
        identity-based features, and all security considerations.

    <h1 class="subHead">Community Mental Health Data Application</h1>
    <p class="subSub" style="clear: both;"><i>INTEX Fall 2023 Project</i></p>
    <br>
    <p class="bodyText">
        For my first INTEX project, over the course of four days, I and a team of 3 others spent about 70 
        hours each developing provomentalhealth.org. Like my other project, this app is no longer hosted online,
        but can be run locally--reach out to me to check it out!
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="bodyText">
        The web app is a tool for gethering and analyizing data regarding the relationship between social media 
        usage and mental health. It was built with Node.js and deployed to the internet using AWS Elastic
        Beanstalk and coupled with a database hosted on RDS. The app features a survey for gathering data, a
        dashboard for analysis, and two administrator-only features: an "Add User" function and a full report of
        all survey responses.

    <p class="bodyText">
        The survey includes 21 questions regarding the respondent's social media usage and mental health. The
        results of each response are stored in the app's database (hosted on RDS for the online site) and used 
        to inform the dashboard and report.

        The dashboard feature is available to all the app's users and displays trends and insights for all 
        survey respondents or for a selection of respondents based on filters. The dashboard was developed 
        with Tableau.

        Users logged into administrator accounts are able to add other users to the app's identity
